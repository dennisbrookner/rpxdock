Version 2 of the venerable tcdock and rpxdock programs in rosetta. This version will be faster, simpler, and mostly in python.

Most of this code assumes all cyclic oligomers have their axis on Z (0,0,1) and dihedral oligmers have their highest order symmetry axis along Z and a twofold axis along X (1,0,0).

For information on how to setup / install and use the code, please see the preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.25.513641v1.full.pdf
